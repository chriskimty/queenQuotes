<h3 align="center">Are you a true RuPaul's Drag Race fan👑💋?</h3>

<a href="https://queenquotes.netlify.app/">Queen Quotes</a> is a quiz app where squirrel friends🐿 (aka users) can test their knowledge about famous catchphrases from the queens of RuPaul's Drag Race.

<p>This project was created by <a href="https://github.com/paulavivasteixeira">Paula Vivas</a> and <a href="https://github.com/chriskimty">Chris Kim</a>, completed in October 2022 with <a href="https://junocollege.com">Juno College's</a> Web Development Bootcamp ✨ Cohort 44 ✨, as part of a paired-programming JavaScript project.</p>

<p>The project showcases our understanding of:</p>

- Working with Firebase Realtime Database
- Core Vanilla JavaScript concepts
- DOM manipulation
- Error handling and UI design
- Competence in pair programming and communication
- Worked with third-party API (\*API is no longer in service)

<p>
Updated in Feb 2023: Using Firebase Realtime DB, we created our own database of Queens'👑 information!
